# Access Randomizer

A Hollow Knight Randomizer add-on for miscellaneous access checks.

## Mantis Respect

Originally, defeating the Mantis Lords grants all the tribe's respect. This mod turns that into a check, meaning you can get their respect elsewhere and defeating the lords will grant a random item.

Also, if you defeat them without having their respect, they might get a bit salty.

## Hollow Knight Chains

Meant to make playthroughs a bit longer, this adds four items and locations representing the chains that bind the Hollow Knight. Each item will grant the possibility of breaking one of the four chains, and each chain will grant an item. These are considered Major Items, which means they will be penalised by the Longer Progression Chains setting and will be included in the Condensed Spoiler Logger.

If Dreamers are duplicated, two extra Chain items will be included in the pool.

## Unique Keys

This will remove the Simple Key item and replace them with four specific keys for each of the doors meant to be opened with simple keys. In terms of logic, this will very likely get all locations behind these keys be unlocked earlier in progression (as you will no longer need all four keys to reach any of them).

This setting will also permanently add a "Key Tracker" item in your inventory (replacing the Simple Key) that will keep track of which keys have you obtained and which doors were opened.

This setting deletes the concept of Simple Key, and the resulting keys will be duplicated or not depending on the Unique Keys setting. The usage of this setting will override the Key Ring item from Extra Rando (no point in using both, so if you want to have them all in a single location, disable this).
