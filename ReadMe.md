# Access Randomizer

A Hollow Knight Randomizer add-on for miscellaneous access checks.

## Mantis Respect

Originally, defeating the Mantis Lords grants all the tribe's respect. This mod turns that into a check, meaning you can get their respect elsewhere and defeating the lords will grant a random item.

Also, if you defeat them without having their respect, they might get a bit salty.

## Hollow Knight Chains

Meant to make playthroughs a bit longer, this adds four items and locations representing the chains that bind the Hollow Knight. Each item will grant the possibility of breaking one of the four chains, and each chain will grant an item. These are considered Major Items, which means they will be penalised by the Longer Progression Chains setting and will be included in the Condensed Spoiler Logger.
